# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
## Aim of the project 
The aim of this project is to automatically 
convert handwritten text into machine 
encoded text.
## problem statement 
A medical company needs to take handwritten prescription and retrieve the text from it. To do 
this manually, it will require a lot of time and lots of cost to the company. So, the company 
wants to automate this task. You need to create a neural network model that will take images 
as input, read the text images, and convert it into digital text. 
To solve this problem, you need to create a CNN LSTM model.
